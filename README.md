I'm trying to create something...

So, if you want to play with project, you'll need to do some prep work.
- Install Python 3.x and Flask -* On the future I might make it automatic... might, do not qoute me on that
- Run the 'setup.py' as administrator (Windows) or sudo (Linux - Not tested yet :P)
- To the flask applications, you can either run the 'main.py' for each app, or execute the run.bat or run.sh (win/linux - to be made)

It should word fine... It works for me :D
