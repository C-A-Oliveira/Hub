I'm trying to create something... Right now it's just a messy-ish sandbox for me, so don't expect much from me

So, if you want to play with project, you'll need to do some prep work.
- Install Python 3.x and Flask -* On the future I might make it automatic... might, do not qoute me on that
- Run the 'setup.py' as administrator (Windows) or sudo (Linux - Not tested yet :P)
- To the flask applications, you can either run the 'main.py' for each app, or execute the run.bat or run.sh (win/linux - to be made)

It should word fine... It works for me :D

## What I intend to with this in "near" future:
> - Add a few more codes in various programming lenguages like JavaScript, C#, and what not...
> - Add a database of some sort
> - Make it an docker image do be deployed/bacekd-up... I don't really know, I'm thinking and writing stuff here
> - Get my hands on a Raspberry Pi to use it as host when it's 'finished'... maybe even a few raspberries to make a server network of some sort... it'd be hella cool :D
# NOTHING IS A PROMISSE! DON'T ASK ME TO FINISH THIS IF I STOP AT SOME POINT!!
